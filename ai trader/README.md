# Cloud-Based AI Trading Assistant

A comprehensive cloud-hosted trading assistant that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) for automated trade strategy development and GenAI 2.0 for AI-driven insights. This system is accessible from anywhere, requires no local execution, and provides a rich, interactive web dashboard covering all aspects of trading—from strategy backtesting to risk management and performance analytics.

1. **RL Trading Agent** - A reinforcement learning model that develops and optimizes trading strategies
2. **Interactive Dashboard** - A web-based interface for monitoring trades, analyzing performance, and managing strategies
3. **Strategy Library** - A repository for developing, customizing, and backtesting trading strategies
4. **User Management System** - Authentication, authorization, and subscription management
5. **Advanced Analytics** - Performance metrics, sentiment analysis, and pattern recognition
