# AI Trading Assistant: Simple Cloud Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your AI Trading Assistant to the cloud for free, with no prior coding experience required. We've simplified the process into easy-to-follow steps.

## What You'll Need

1. A Google account (to get a free API key)
2. A GitHub account (to store your project)
3. A Render.com account (to host your project online for free)

## Step 1: Get Your Google API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy your new API key (it looks like a long string of letters and numbers)
5. Keep this key safe - you'll need it later!

*Note: For security reasons, never share screenshots of your actual API key*

## Step 2: Set Up GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for a free account if you don't have one
2. After signing in, click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "ai-trading-assistant")
4. Make sure "Public" is selected
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Upload Your Project to GitHub

1. In your new repository, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop all your project files or select them from your computer
   - Make sure to include ALL files from the AI Trading Assistant project
   - Don't worry if you're not sure which files to include - just upload everything!
3. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

*Tip: You can upload multiple files at once by selecting them all before dragging*

## Step 4: Deploy on Render.com

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com/) and sign up for a free account
2. After signing in, click the "New +" button and select "Web Service"
3. Click "Connect account" under GitHub and authorize Render to access your GitHub account
4. Find and select your "ai-trading-assistant" repository
5. Configure your service with these settings:
   - **Name**: ai-trading-assistant (or any name you prefer)
   - **Environment**: Python
   - **Region**: Choose the one closest to you
   - **Branch**: main
   - **Build Command**: Copy and paste this exactly:
     ```
     apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential wget pkg-config && wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz && tar -xzf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz && cd ta-lib/ && ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install && cd .. && pip install numpy && export TA_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib && export TA_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include && pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-L/usr/lib/" --global-option="-I/usr/include/" ta-lib || pip install git+https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib.git@master
     ```
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn dashboard.app:server`
   - **Plan**: Free

*Important: Make sure to copy the entire build command exactly as shown above*

6. Add your environment variables:
   - Click "Advanced" button
   - Click "Add Environment Variable"
   - Add the following variable:
     - **Key**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
     - **Value**: Paste your Google API key from Step 1

*Remember: Your API key should be kept private and secure*

7. Click "Create Web Service"

## Step 5: Wait for Deployment

1. Render will now build and deploy your application
2. This process takes about 5-10 minutes (be patient - the ta-lib installation takes time!)
3. You can watch the build logs to see the progress

*Note: The deployment process can take up to 10 minutes, especially during the TA-Lib installation*

## Step 6: Access Your Deployed Application

1. Once deployment is complete, Render will show "Your service is live ðŸŽ‰"
2. Click the URL at the top of the page (it will look like `https://ai-trading-assistant.onrender.com`)
3. Your AI Trading Assistant is now accessible from anywhere in the world!

*Success! Your application is now live and accessible from anywhere*

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Application Error" or Blank Page

**Solution:**
- Wait a few more minutes - the free tier can be slow to start up (sometimes up to 5 minutes)
- Check the Render logs for specific errors by clicking on "Logs" in your Render dashboard
- Make sure your Google API key is correctly entered in the environment variables

### Issue: TA-Lib Installation Fails

**Solution:**
- The build command already includes multiple fallback methods to install TA-Lib
- If it still fails, try redeploying by clicking "Manual Deploy" > "Clear build cache & deploy"
- If you continue to have issues, check the Render logs for specific error messages
- The most common issue is related to the C compiler - our build command should handle this automatically

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError" or "ImportError"

**Solution:**
- This usually means a required package is missing
- Check if all files were uploaded to GitHub correctly
- Make sure your repository includes the `requirements.txt` file
- Try redeploying with "Clear build cache & deploy"

### Issue: "Free instance hours depleted"

**Solution:**
- Render's free tier provides 750 hours per month
- If you've used all your hours, wait until the next month or upgrade to a paid plan

## Important Notes About Free Hosting

- **Sleep Mode**: On the free tier, your app will "go to sleep" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Wake-up Time**: When someone visits your sleeping app, it will take about 30-60 seconds to "wake up"
- **Performance**: The free tier has limited resources, so your app might be slower than on your local computer
- **Monthly Limits**: Render provides 750 free hours per month, which is enough for most personal projects

## Security Tips

- Never share your Google API key publicly
- Consider adding authentication to your app if you're handling sensitive data
- Regularly check your Google API usage to avoid unexpected charges

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your AI Trading Assistant to the cloud. Here are some things you might want to do next:

1. Share your app's URL with friends or colleagues
2. Add more features to your project and redeploy
3. Set up a custom domain name (requires a paid Render plan)
